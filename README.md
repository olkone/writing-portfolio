## Reflection
This project was my first time collaborating with another person on a development project. My collaborator had no HTML, CSS, or programming knowledge, so communication had to be precise. I found it difficult at first to communicate the possibilities and the limitations of my current knowledge of HTML and CSS. However, as we worked on the project it got easier for both of us to articulate our ideas using technical and non-technical language.

The project started out with a main home page with separate pages for each document. My collaborator and I agreed this setup felt "heavy" for the small size of this project. We then switched to a single, continuous home page.

At one point, my collaborator pointed out that having all of the PDFs on one webpage made the page load sluggishly and made scrolling difficult. Not wanting to implement the multi-page setup again, we compromised on creating buttons, linking the PDFs, and having them open in a new tab.

Even when our creative visions didn't align, we were able to make a great end-product which we were both proud of because of our clear and frequent communication.
